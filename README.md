# Prediction of Risky Credit Customers

<p>Our aim with this project is to investigate if there is a correlation between certain features
in the dataset and if there is risk of issuing a loan to certain types of customers. An example could be 
if there is a correlation between age and risk. We want to make a model which predicts and categorizes if a person is 
in risk of being a ‘bad’ loaner. A such solution might be in value for institutions like banks, who issue loans. </p>

<b>The Dataset</b>

<p>The dataset used in this project is named ’German Credit Data Risk’ and is collected from banks in Germany.
It was published in 2016 but the data has been collected before this.The dataset contains 1000 entries with 10 categories, 
where one entry represent a person who has credit in a bank</p>
